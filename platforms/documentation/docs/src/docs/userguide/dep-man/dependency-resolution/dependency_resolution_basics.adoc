= Dependency Resolution Basics

Dependency resolution in Gradle can largely be thought of as a two-step process.
The first being _graph resolution_, and the second being _artifact resolution_:

1. **Graph resolution phase**:
- Driven by declared dependencies
- Uses attributes assigned to the configuration

2. **Artifact resolution phase**:
- Based on nodes in the dependency graph
- Matches the variant of each node

The results of these processes are presented through a variety of types, each catering to different use cases.

== Graph Resolution

In the _graph resolution_ phase, Gradle downloads and examines component metadata (GMM, POM, and IVY XML) for declared and transitive dependencies to construct a *dependency graph*.

The `ResolutionResult` represents the output of the graph resolution phase, which focuses solely on the nodes in the dependency graph, not the artifacts (files) they expose:

- link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/result/ResolvedComponentResult.html[ResolvedComponentResult] and link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/result/ResolvedVariantResult.html[ResolvedVariantResult] - Exposes the raw dependency graph without resolving artifacts, describing the relationships between components and variants.

== Artifact Resolution

In the _artifact resolution_ phase, artifacts are selected typically using the same attributes that built the *dependency graph*.

An `ArtifactView` operates on top of the resolved dependency graph (i.e., `ResolutionResult`).
It queries the graph for specific artifacts, enabling artifact resolution with different attributes:

- link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/file/FileCollection.html[FileCollection] - A flat list of files. This is the most common way to access dependency resolution results.
- link:{javadocPath}/org/gradle/api/artifacts/ArtifactCollection.html[ArtifactCollection] - Provides access to the metadata for each resolved artifact in addition to the file itself.
